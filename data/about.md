It's being *directed* and written by a genius name David Ward who - oh, I
don't know - won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And it was
his pen and his vision that created the classic that we know today as Major
League. He's as radical as you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just
my dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up the river to kill another part of
me, which is 'courage'.

Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those

Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those
people', and I have cleansed myself. I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all
have to sit in here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look
like you're having a lot of fun.
